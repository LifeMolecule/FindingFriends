Finding Friends card game 


get rpf to work
define "getCard in the player class"

Make the logic of the class follow if trump or if not trump, use trump and pretend as if there r only 4 suits.
Make it either choose a card, a double, This will probably be a huge method with showing the player/the cpu which cards they can play and having the cpu either choose "points, lowest, or highest" playing doubles before singles.
