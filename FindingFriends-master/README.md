Finding Friends card game 

1. Currently creating card searcher to be used when cpu is leading(look below)


2. change typeofplay and suitofplay at bottom of getCard(No param)

3. determine where to print who played what
{Arraylist printer in dealer?}

4. get order working in gameRound in dealer; Winning the round calculator(in gameRound)

5. make getCard for the leading dude work (CPU), choose what other variables the cpu should keep in mind

6. make getCard(param) work

7. CPU LOGIC
showing the player/the cpu which cards they can play and having the cpu either choose "points, lowest, or highest" playing doubles before singles. 


if cpu leading, chooses looks if there is no trump ace, plays ace (whatever the main value is Maybe make a card searcher function with a value parameter?), else play double over the value of 10 (non trump), else random number 1-4, then plays the highest card.

If cpu not leading, look at arraylists, play points if partner is leading else play low card, else if partner is not leading play high card, else play required card. 




8. Game changer(After everything works and the game is over, determines which team wins and moves onto 3's etc);
